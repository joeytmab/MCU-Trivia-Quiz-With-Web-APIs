Timed quiz game featuring challenging Marvel Cinematic Universe Trivia.

User will be prompted with instructions for the quiz upon visiting the page. Upon clicking on the "Assemble!" button, quiz questions immediately populate page.
Timer counts down once quiz begins.

If time runs out, user will be sent back to beginning of quiz to try again.

When all questions are answered, user is given his/her final score, followed by a prompt to enter initials. The score is then uploaded and stored onto localStorage with their name.

(By the way, anyone who can ace this quiz in the first couple of tries is impressive. These questions are DIFFICULT!)
